The command to run BrailleBlaster is simply

java -jar brailleblaster.jar 

If you are running a Mac build use the following command:

java -XstartOnFirstThread -jar brailleblaster.jar

This command may be placed in a shortcut with a suitable path. If the 
shortcut is placed on the desktop it need only include the path to the 
.jar file. 

BrailleBlaster accepts subcommands and filenames on the command line. 
To use them simply type them after a space after the above command, 
followed by spaces and suitable arguments. File names should simply be 
typed after brailleblaster.jar and a space. They will be opened in the 
word processor. The subcommands are:

translate: translate a file into braille. The simplest usage of this 
subcommand is:

java-jar brailleblaster.jar translate inputfile outputfile

If your system does not have a GUI or it canot be reached for some 
reason, you will get an error message saying that it could not be found. 
You can still use the subcommands by putting -nogui as the first 
argument. For example:

java -jar brailleblaster.jar -nogui translate inputfile outputfile

The translate subcommand has many options. It will handle text, html and 
xml files. It will even back-translate. To learn about the options look 
at the section on file2brl in the documentation on liblouisutdml, which 
is in the helpDocs subdirectory. BrailleBlaster does not run the 
file2brl program. It emulates it.

emboss: translate a file and then emboss it. This is like the translate 
subcommand, except that outputfile is replaced by embossername. To find 
the name of the embosser on your system use the EmbossNow! menu item in 
the wordprocessor and note the name.

If no arguments are given after brailleblaster.jar, or the argument is a 
file name, the application enters the wordprocessor. It may display 
startup dialogs if this is the first time you are using it or you have 
not disabled these dialogs. You can then proceed to work on doocuments 
as in most other word processors, and you can also view and edit braille 
translations of documents in a special window.

The command to run BrailleBlaster is simply

java -jar brailleblaster.jar 

This command may be placed in a shortcut with a suitable path. If the 
shortcut is placed on the desktop it need only include the path to the 
.jar file. 

BrailleBlaster accepts subcommands. To use them simply type them after a 
space after the above command, followed by spaces and suitable 
arguments. They are:

translate: translate a file into braille
emboss: translate a file and then emboss it
help: print a list of subcommands
help [subcommand]: print detailed information on the subcommand

If no arguments are given after brailleblaster.jar the application 
enters the wordprocessor. It may display startup dialogs if this is the 
first time you are using it or you have not disabled these dialogs. You 
can then proceed to work on doocuments as in most other word processors, 
and you can also view and edit braille translations of documents in a 
special window.

This file describes the packages and classes in BrailleBlaster. It is 
recommended reading for anyone writing code for the project.

package org.brailleblaster

class Main: This class contains the main method, which starts 
BrailleBlaster and cleans up when it is finished.

class BBIni: This clas handles command-line options beginning with "-" 
and almost everything needed to set up BrailleBlaster, including 
determining platform-dependent paths and other things and loading 
liblouisutdml. Other classes seldom have to be concerned with 
differences between platforms.

Class Subcommands: This class handles the subcommands like translate, 
emboss, checktable, etc. It is called by the main method after BBIni if 
there are subcommands. If something is given on the command line that is 
not a subcommand it assumes that it is the name of a file to be 
processed by the wordprocessor and passes control to WPManager.

class ParseCommandLine: This class is currently unused. It was written 
to process complex command lines. However, Subcommands appears to do an 
adequate job. ParseCommandLine may therefore be eliminated.

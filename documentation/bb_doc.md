“The [BrailleBlaster] application is intended to
let loose a blast of braille, like a blast of fresh air for people suffocating for lack of good technical material in braille. That has been my experience since childhood.”
--John Boyer, software developer and originator of the BrailleBlaster project

###Key Commands

This document uses the "+" to indicate a series of keys that should be pressed together. The notation Alt+F, for example, means to hold down the Alt key, then while that key is still down, press the F key. Once the F is down, release the F and the Alt. You should not type the +; it is merely used to show that two or more keys should be pressed together.

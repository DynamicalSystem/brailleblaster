To build BrailleBlaster you must have Ant installed on your machine or 
an IDE that can execute an Ant build.xml file. In addition, you must 
copy the following .jar files into the directory dist/lib

The swt.jar for your platform
apache-commons-exec-1.1.jar
jdom.jar
jeuclid.jar
jliblouisutdml.jar
hunspell.jar

Then run ant. This will place brailleblaster.jar in the dist directory.

You must also compile a number of C and C++ files for your platform. Be 
sure they compile into dist/native

liblouis
liblouisutdml
itex2MML (requires flex and bison)
hunspell (linked with its bindings)

The compilation shhould place command-line toolls in the bin 
sibdirectory, libraries in the lib subdirectory and platform-independent 
files in the share subdirectory. It may also produce a number of other 
subdirectories. These are not necessary for BrailleBlaster and should be 
deleted.

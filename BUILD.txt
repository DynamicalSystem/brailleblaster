To build BrailleBlaster you must have Ant installed on your machine or 
an IDE that can execute an Ant build.xml file. In addition, you must 
copy the following .jar files into the directory dist/lib

The swt.jar for your platform
apache-commons-exec-1.1.jar
xom.jar
jeuclid.jar
jliblouisutdml.jar (bindings)
hunspell.jar (bindings)

Then run ant. This will place brailleblaster.jar in the dist directory.

You must also compile a number of C and C++ programs and libraries for 
your platform. Be sure they compile into dist/native

liblouis
liblouisutdml
itex2MML (requires flex and bison)
hunspell (linked with its bindings)

The compilation should place command-line toolls in the bin 
sibdirectory, libraries in the lib subdirectory and platform-independent 
files in the programData subdirectory. It may also produce a number of 
other subdirectories. These are not necessary for BrailleBlaster and 
should be deleted. The binary components may also be compiled into their 
default locations and the necessary parts copied into the appropriate 
BrailleBlaster locations.

Rename the dist directory brailleblaster and package it in a way 
suitable for your platform. you may want to place a shortcut with the 
path to brailleblaster.jar on your desktop.

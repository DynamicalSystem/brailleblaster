This file is a suppleement to README.txt. You may find it advantageous 
to read that file to get an idea of the structure and operation of 
BrailleBlaster.

BrailleBlaster was written using Java 6, because that was what was 
available. The Ant build.xml file enables compilation on Java 5, 6 and 
7. The jar files produced should run on any of these versions. The 
developers may move to Java 7 if it contains new usable features.

The best way to build BrailleBlaster is to clone the Mercurial 
reopsitory and then place native and jar files in their proper 
directories, as described below.

To build BrailleBlaster you must have Ant installed on your machine or 
an IDE that can execute an Ant build.xml file. In addition, you must 
copy the following .jar files into the directory dist/lib

The swt.jar for your platform
commons-cli-1.2.jar
commons-exec-1.1.jar
jliblouisutdml.jar (bindings)
xom.jar
(others as time goes on) 

These .jar files can be downloaded from the "for developers" page at 
httP://www.brailleblaster.org

Then run ant. This will place brailleblaster.jar in the dist directory.

You must also compile a number of C and C++ programs and libraries for 
your platform. Be sure they compile into dist/native

liblouis
liblouisutdml
libxml2
(Others as time goes on)

On Linux and Mac compiled libraries should be copied into the 
dist/native/lib subdirectory. Linux sustems usually have libxml2 
installed, so it need not be compiled. On Windows systems compiled 
libraries should be placed in the dist directory along with the 
brailleblaster.jar file created by Ant. This may change in the future.

Rename the dist directory brailleblaster and package it in a way 
suitable for your platform. you may want to place a shortcut with the 
path to brailleblaster.jar on your desktop.
